Undocumented APIs
-----------------

ndspy usually contains some undocumented Python modules. You can use these
modules if you like, but such modules have provisional APIs -- that is, they're
subject to change (or even removal) at any time. Documented modules, on the
other hand, follow semantic versioning.

``ndspy.lz10``: LZ10 Compression
================================

.. py:module:: ndspy.lz10

``ndspy.lz10`` provides functions for compression and decompression in the
*LZ10* compression format used in some games.

.. seealso::

    This module also includes a :doc:`command-line interface <../cli/lz10>`.


.. py:function:: compress(data)

    Compress data in *LZ10* format. This is the inverse of
    :py:func:`decompress`.

    :param bytes data: The data to compress.

    :returns: The compressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: compressFromFile(filePath)

    Load a filesystem file, and compress its contents. This is the inverse of
    :py:func:`decompressToFile`, and is a convenience function.

    :param filePath: The path to the file to open.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object

    :returns: The compressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: compressToFile(data, filePath)

    Compress data in *LZ10* format, and save it to a filesystem file. This is
    the inverse of :py:func:`decompressFromFile`, and is a convenience
    function.

    :param bytes data: The data to compress.

    :param filePath: The path to the compressed file to save to.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object


.. py:function:: decompress(data)

    Decompress data that was compressed using *LZ10*. This is the inverse of
    :py:func:`compress`.

    :param bytes data: The compressed data.

    :returns: The decompressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: decompressFromFile(filePath)

    Load a *LZ10*-compressed filesystem file, and decompress it. This is the
    inverse of :py:func:`compressToFile`, and is a convenience function.

    :param filePath: The path to the compressed file to open.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object

    :returns: The decompressed data.
    :rtype: :py:class:`bytes`


.. py:function:: decompressToFile(data, filePath)

    Decompress data that was compressed using *LZ10*, and save it to a
    filesystem file. This is the inverse of :py:func:`compressFromFile`, and is
    a convenience function.

    :param bytes data: The data to decompress.

    :param filePath: The path to the file to save to.
    :type filePath: :py:class:`str` or other path-like object


.. py:function:: main([args])

    This is the main function for :doc:`this module's command-line interface
    <../cli/lz10>`. This allows you to invoke the CLI programmatically, if you
    would like.

    :param args: The command-line arguments. Defaults to ``sys.argv`` if not
        provided.
    :type args: :py:class:`list` of :py:class:`str`

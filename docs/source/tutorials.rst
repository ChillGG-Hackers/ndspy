Tutorials
=========

This section contains tutorials to help you learn how to use ndspy!

I suggest starting with :doc:`tutorial00-gettingStarted` to ensure that you've
installed ndspy correctly and know how to run the correct copy of Python. After
that, you should try :doc:`tutorial01-editingRom`, which is intended to be a
relatively gentle introduction to basic ndspy usage. Once you've completed both
of those, you can pretty much jump around to whatever tutorials interest you.

Some familiarity with Python is assumed; however, we won't be using any
particularly advanced syntax [1]_, so it's OK if you're not too good at it yet.

These tutorials use *New Super Mario Bros.* as the example game, because it's
popular and it's what I'm most familiar with. However, ndspy should work with
any games that use file formats it supports.

    ``with`` blocks for opening files could be considered an exception;
    however, you don't really need to understand how they work in order to use
    them.

``ndspy.lz10``: LZ10 Compression
================================

:py:mod:`ndspy.lz10`'s command-line interface allows you to easily compress and
decompress files in the *LZ10* format. You can access it through
``python3 -m ndspy.lz10`` or ``ndspy_lz10``, or programmatically with
:py:func:`ndspy.lz10.main`.

Usage summary:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python3 -m ndspy.lz10 -h
    usage: lz10.py [-h] {compress,c,decompress,d} ...

    ndspy.lz10 CLI: Compress or decompress files using LZ10.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    commands:
      (run a command with -h for additional help)

      {compress,c,decompress,d}
        compress (c)        compress a file
        decompress (d)      decompress a file

The module provides commands for compression and decompression:


Compress (``compress`` / ``c``)
-------------------------------

Usage summary:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python3 -m ndspy.lz10 compress -h
    usage: lz10.py compress [-h] input_file [output_file]

    positional arguments:
      input_file   input file to compress
      output_file  what to save the compressed file as

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit

This command compresses a file in the *LZ10* format. If no output filename is
given, it defaults to the input filename, with a ``.cmp`` extension.


Decompress (``decompress`` / ``d``)
-----------------------------------

Usage summary:

.. code-block:: text

    $ python3 -m ndspy.lz10 decompress -h
    usage: lz10.py decompress [-h] input_file [output_file]

    positional arguments:
      input_file   input file to decompress
      output_file  what to save the decompressed file as

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit

This command decompresses a *LZ10*-compressed file. If no output filename is
given, it defaults to the input filename, with a ``.dec`` extension.
